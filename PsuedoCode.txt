int global_counter = 4

Interrupt Programme:

Interrupt on push button
Increment +1 to global counter
	if counter >= 4 (reset to 1)


main(void):
{
Check programme counter
if counter = 1 (run programme 1)
if counter = 2 (run programme 2)
if counter = 3 (run programme 3)
if counter = 4 (run programme 4)
}


Programme 1 (Manual colour change):
{
read Variable Resistor pin 1 = Dimming amount
read Variable Resistor pin 2 = Colour wheel value
}


Programme 2 (Temperature sensor):
{
read temperature
if temp <12 = Blue
if temp >12 && <17 = Green
if temp >=17 && <20 = yellow 
if temp >=20 && <=25 = orange
if temp >25 && <30 = Red
if temp >30 = purple
read variable resistor pin 1 = Dimming amount
divide output values by dimming amount
}


Programme 3 (Random colours):
{
dimming amount = choose a random value for dimming (1 - 255)
read variable resistor pin 1 = dimming amount
divide dimming number by overall dimming amount
led number = Pick a random number between 1 and #number of LEDs
send to LED address (led number)
delay (delayed by amount on dial - up to 2 second)
}



Programme 4 (switch off):
{
set all LED values to 0
}
